My name is Reymond Akpanya and I am a PhD student in the field of simplicial surfaces under the supervision of 
Prof. Dr. Alice C. Niemeyer and Prof. Dr. Wilhelm Plesken.

PhD project
======
A simplcial surface is the combinatorial structure that describes the incidence relations between the vertices, edges 
and faces of a triangulated 2-dimensional manifold. The goal of my project is to analyse these surfaces and derive
methods to construct simplicial surfaces with prescribed properties. Based on this combinatorial description I aim to 
embed given simplicial surfaces into the Euclidean space in such a way that the embedding yields a polyhedron with 
certain geometric properties e.g. convexity or interlocking properties.
