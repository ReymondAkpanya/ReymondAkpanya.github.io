> __Description__: From August 5 to 9, 2024, children and young people were invited to experience a creative week at the
> Rolleferberg Youth Education Center. In cooperation with the Bleiberger Fabrik and the Werkwochen, this workshop 
> offered young people the opportunity to experiment with concrete and realize their own creative ideas under the 
> guidance of artists such as Andreas Robertz and Silke Franke.<br>
> The Concrete Art Project 2024 was enriched by the additional support of young scientists from the SFB/TRR280. These
> young experts from various disciplines, such as mathematics and structural engineering, imparted valuable knowledge
> to the participants. Hands-on experiments such as building a polyhedron out of paper, a hammer test for concrete 
> slabs and Q&A sessions on bridge construction aroused interest in research and science. The aim of the CRC/TRR280
> is to introduce children and young people to scientific concepts in a playful way and to encourage a lasting 
> interest in these topics.
