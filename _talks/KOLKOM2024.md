> __Abstract__: A (simplicial) surface can be seen as the incidence geometry of the vertices, edges and faces of a
> triangulated 2-manifold. We call such a surface face-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively
> on the faces of the given surface. Linking a given simplicial surface to a cubic graph is achieved by 
> recording the incidences between the corresponding faces and edges. Note that the resulting cubic graph
> does not directly contain any information on the vertices of the corresponding surface. This missing 
> information is obtained by constructing a cycle double cover (CDC) of the corresponding cubic graph, 
> i.e. a collection of cycles of the graph such that every edge of the graph is contained in exactly 
> two cycles. In this talk, we discuss the construction of face-transitive surfaces by providing suitable 
> CDCs of vertex-transitive cubic graphs. We demonstrate that the CDC of a given cubic graph corresponding
> to a face-transitive surface can be constructed by exploiting suitable subgroups of the automorphism
> group of the given cubic graph. This is a joint work with Jonathan Spreer (Usyd).<br><br>
