> __Abstract__: A topological interlocking assembly is an arrangement of several rigid blocks that are in 
> contact with each other and are constrained by a fixed frame such that each subset of blocks is 
> kinematically constrained and therefore cannot be removed from the whole assembly. The platonic 
> solids are examples of convex blocks that allow such interlocking assemblies, see [1]. Exploiting
> topological interlocking enables the construction of large concrete structures without the usage 
> of mortar as binding material. Over the years various blocks that give rise to topological interlocking
> assemblies by assembling copies of a given block, have been proposed. Dyskin et al. are notable pioneers
> in the field of topological interlocking [1]. In [2], the authors provide an recent overview of
> assemblies with interlocking properties. In this presentation, we discuss an algebraic construction
> method that facilitates the design of various topological interlocking assemblies. More precisely, 
> we construct blocks whose copies can be assembled to form tubular structures with interlocking 
> properties. This is achieved by exploiting two dimensional crystallographic groups, i.e. the 
> symmetries of periodic wall paper patterns. Here, we focus on the design of tubular topological
> interlocking assemblies that prevent certain simultaneous movements of the blocks in the assembly
> when the frame remains unfixed. The motions of interest are the simultaneous radially outwards movement
> of every block. Hence, we generate examples of tubular interlocking assemblies that prevent the described
> motions and compare their structural behaviour to the behaviour of interlocking assemblies that do not prevent
> these movements when the frame is not fixed. In particular, we achieve this comparison by conducting several 
> finite element studies. Moreover, we address the challenge of manufacturing the proposed structures with carbon
> reinforced concrete.
