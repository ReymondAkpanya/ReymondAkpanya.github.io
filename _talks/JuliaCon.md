>Polygonal complexes are combinatoric objects that arise from polyhedra and facilitate various combinatoric and geometric
>studies. In this talk, we present the Julia package GeoCombSurfX which enables the study of polygonal complexes and the
>construction of their corresponding embedding. Moreover, we demonstrate the usage of our package by targeting the problem
>of deciding whether a given asssembly of 3D-blocks gives rise to a topological interlocking.

>This talk was given together with Sascha St√ºttgen.
