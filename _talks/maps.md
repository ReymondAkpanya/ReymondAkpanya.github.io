> __Abstract__: Simplicial surfaces describe the incidence relations of triangulated surfaces. Such a combinatoric
> structure can be linked to its dual graph (face graph) by observing the incidences between the faces and edges 
> of the given simplicial surface. Note, the resulting face graph is a bridgeless cubic 3-connected graph. In 
> general, it is not clear whether there exists a simplicial surface with a given cubic graph as face graph. In
> this talk, we discuss the task of constructing a simplicial surface with a given cubic graph as face graph. We
> introduce some basic notions and give examples of cubic graphs with corresponding simplicial surfaces. 
> Furthermore, we present classes of cubic graphs where the existence of corresponding simplicial surface
> can be established.
