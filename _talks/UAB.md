A simplicial surface is the combinatorial structure that results from examining the incidence relations between the vertices, edges and faces of a triangulated polyhedron. We refer to such a simplicial surface as face-transitive if the corresponding automorphism group acts transitively on the faces of the given surface. Furthermore, a simplicial surface can be linked to its dual graph, a cubic graph, by denoting the incidences between its faces and edges. While translating a simplicial surface into a cubic graph is straightforward, determining whether there exists a simplicial surface with a given cubic graph as dual graph is a task of high complexity. In particular, this computation is achieved by computing a cycle double cover of a given cubic graph, i.e. a collection of cycles of the graph such that every edge of the graph is contained in exactly two cycles. However, when dealing with face-transitive surfaces, there is some optimism in tackling this challenge. In this talk, we will discuss the computation of face-transitive surfaces by providing suitable cycle double covers of vertex-transitive cubic graphs. We will demonstrate that the cycle double cover of a given cubic graph that yields a face-transitive surface can be obtained by exploiting the automorphism group of the given graph.  Moreover, we will see that there are exactly 7 different types of face-transitive surfaces and also provide an distinguishing invariant to tell them apart. This is a joint work with Jonathan Spreer.
