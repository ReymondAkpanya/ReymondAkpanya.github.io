>__Abstract__: A simplicial surface can be derived from the incidence geometry of a 
>triangulated three-dimensional polyhedron by denoting the relationships between 
>the corresponding vertices, edges and faces. We refer to a simplicial surface as 
>face-transitive if the corresponding automorphism group acts transitively on the 
>faces of the simplicial surface.<br><br>

>We link a simplicial surface to its dual graph, a cubic graph, by denoting the 
>incidences between its faces and edges. While translating a surface into a cubic 
>graph is straightforward, determining whether there exists a simplicial surface with 
>a given cubic graph as dual graph is a task of high complexity. However, when dealing 
>with vertex-transitive cubic graphs, there is some optimism in tackling this challenge.
>In this talk, we will discuss the computation of face-transitive surfaces that have 
>vertex-transitive cubic graphs as their dual graphs. We will demonstrate that, in the 
>case of a vertex-transitive cubic graph, the necessary information for this construction 
>can be recovered from the automorphism group of the cubic graph. Moreover, we will see 
>that there are exactly 11 different types of face-transitive surfaces that can occur and 
>also provide distinguishing invariants to tell them apart.
