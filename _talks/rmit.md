The study of symmetric objects occurs in various branches of mathematics.  Periodic tessellations of the Euclidean plane are examples of such structures.

In this talk, we discuss the idea of deforming tiles of a periodic tiling to construct topological interlocking assemblies.  Here, a topological interlocking is an assembly of blocks constrained by a fixed frame such that each block is kinematically constrained.  Based on this idea, we give examples of interlocking assemblies which form platonic solids or tubular interlocking structures.
