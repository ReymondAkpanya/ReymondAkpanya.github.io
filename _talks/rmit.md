> __Abstract__: The study of symmetric objects occurs in various branches of mathematics.  Periodic tessellations of the Euclidean 
> plane are examples of such structures.<br>
> In this talk, we discuss the idea of deforming tiles of a periodic tiling to construct topological interlocking 
> assemblies.  Here, a topological interlocking is an assembly of blocks constrained by a fixed frame such that 
> each block is kinematically constrained.  Based on this idea, we give examples of interlocking assemblies which
> form platonic solids or tubular interlocking structures.
