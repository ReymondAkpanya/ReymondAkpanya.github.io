> __Abstract__: Topological interlocking is an abstract concept which requires that, given an assembly of blocks
> with a fixed frame as a constraint, no group of blocks can be removed. We introduce a construction
> kit based on a block, called Versatile Block, that leads to a wide range of possible topological 
> interlocking assemblies. We show that the combinatorics of assembling copies of this block can be linked
> to Truchet tiles. We analyze the self assembly behaviour of the block by presenting experimental results
> based on 3D-printing with inserted magnets and computational experiments using the computer algebra system
> GAP. Furthermore, we present structural examples demonstrating the functionalities of each block in the 
> construction kit. We investigate different design strategies and discuss possible applications in civil
> engineering design, considering possible manufacturing with different choices of material such as carbon
> reinforced concrete.'
